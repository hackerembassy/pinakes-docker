# Pinakes — Docker image

Production-ready, single-container Docker image for **[Pinakes](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes)**, the self-hosted Integrated Library System (ILS).

- **One image, Apache + PHP 8.2** (mod_php) — no separate nginx/fpm container, mirrors the upstream "Apache-only" production target.
- **Built from the official release ZIP** (which already ships a production `vendor/`), so the running image is byte-for-byte the artifact end users deploy — no source duplication, no Composer at build time.
- **Headless install** — set `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and the container installs Pinakes (schema, locale data, bundled plugins, admin user) on first boot, **no web wizard**. Omit them to fall back to the wizard with the database pre-filled.
- **Auto-tracks upstream** — a new Pinakes release automatically rebuilds and republishes this image.
- Published to **GitHub Container Registry** (`ghcr.io`) and, optionally, **Docker Hub**.

> This image bundles Pinakes, which is licensed **GPL-3.0**. See [Attribution & license](#attribution--license).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/pinakes-docker.git
cd pinakes-docker
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set ADMIN_EMAIL + ADMIN_PASSWORD (headless), strong DB passwords,
# and a stable PLUGIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY (printf 'base64:%s\n' "$(openssl rand -base64 32)")
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and log in with the admin credentials you set. That's it.

> Using only `docker compose up -d` pulls the published image. Add `--build` to build it locally from the `Dockerfile`.

### Run the image directly (external database)

```bash
docker run -d --name pinakes -p 8080:80 \
  -e DB_HOST=mydb.example.com -e DB_NAME=pinakes \
  -e DB_USER=pinakes -e DB_PASS='strong-pass' \
  -e ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com -e ADMIN_PASSWORD='strong-admin-pass' \
  -e PLUGIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY="base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -v pinakes_storage:/var/www/html/storage \
  -v pinakes_uploads:/var/www/html/public/uploads \
  fabiodalez/pinakes:latest
```

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables (the entrypoint writes the app's `.env` from them on first boot).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | MySQL host (compose service name). |
| `DB_PORT` | `3306` | MySQL port. |
| `DB_NAME` | `pinakes` | Database name (created automatically if missing). |
| `DB_USER` / `DB_PASS` | `pinakes` / `pinakes` | DB credentials. **Change for production.** |
| `DB_SOCKET` | _(empty)_ | Optional unix socket (takes precedence over host/port). |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` | `production` or `development`. |
| `APP_LOCALE` | `it_IT` | Seed/UI language: `it_IT`, `en_US`, `de_DE`, `fr_FR`. |
| `APP_CANONICAL_URL` | _(empty)_ | Canonical URL for emails/redirects/robots. Set this behind a reverse proxy. |
| `APP_DEBUG` / `DISPLAY_ERRORS` | `false` / `false` | Keep `false` in production. |
| `FORCE_HTTPS` | `false` | Enforce HTTPS/HSTS (TLS detected via `X-Forwarded-Proto`). |
| `SESSION_LIFETIME` | `3600` | Session lifetime (seconds). |
| `PLUGIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | auto | `base64:<32-byte key>` for encrypted plugin settings. **Set a stable value** so secrets survive container recreation. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Set **both** for a fully headless install (skips the wizard). |
| `ADMIN_NAME` / `ADMIN_SURNAME` | `Admin` / `User` | Admin display name. |

### Headless vs. wizard

- **Both `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set** → the container imports the schema, locale data, optimisation indexes, default settings and bundled plugins (including the default-active **Mobile API**), creates the admin user, and writes the `.installed` lock. Pinakes is ready — the installer route then shows _"Already installed"_.
- **Either missing** → everything except the admin user is prepared; you finish the single admin step at `/installer/`.

The install is **idempotent**: on every subsequent boot it detects `.installed` and skips straight to serving.

---

## Persistence

Three things must outlive the container:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `db_data` → `/var/lib/mysql` | the database |
| `storage` → `/var/www/html/storage` | logs, cache, backups, sessions, plugin state |
| `uploads` → `/var/www/html/public/uploads` | book covers, author images, digital assets |

The provided `docker-compose.yml` wires named volumes for all three. Also keep a **stable `PLUGIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (in `.env`) so encrypted plugin settings remain readable after a recreate.

---

## Updating

Pinakes ships an **in-app updater** (Admin → Updates) that works inside the container (the code dir is writable and OPcache revalidates timestamps). For most upgrades, that is the simplest path.

To move the **image** to a new Pinakes version:

```bash
# pin a version
PINAKES_TAG=0.7.23 docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
# or always-latest
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This image **auto-tracks upstream**: every Pinakes release triggers a rebuild here (see below), so `:latest` follows the newest stable Pinakes shortly after it ships.

---

## How auto-update works

```
Pinakes create-release.sh ──repository_dispatch(pinakes_release)──▶ build-publish-docker.yml ──▶ ghcr.io / Docker Hub
                                                          (daily cron safety-net poller backs this up)
```

- **`build-publish-docker.yml`** — builds multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`) from the release ZIP for the requested version and pushes `:<version>` + `:latest`. Fires on the upstream dispatch, a manual `workflow_dispatch`, or a `v*` tag here. It verifies the release ZIP exists before building.
- **`auto-update-on-release.yml`** — records the upstream version in `.latest-pinakes-version` and, on its daily cron, triggers a build if a newer Pinakes release appeared without a dispatch.
- **`smoke-test.yml`** — builds the image and runs `tests/docker-smoke.sh` (full headless-install + HTTP/extension/DB assertions) on every push/PR, so a broken image is never published.

---

## Publishing setup (one-time, for maintainers)

GHCR works out of the box (the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`). To **also** publish to Docker Hub, add two repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | a Docker Hub access token with **Read/Write** scope ([hub.docker.com → Account → Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)) |

Without them, the workflow publishes to GHCR only (and says so).

To let upstream Pinakes trigger rebuilds automatically, add the snippet in [`create-release-snippet.md`](create-release-snippet.md) to Pinakes' `scripts/create-release.sh`.

---

## Building locally

```bash
docker build --build-arg PINAKES_VERSION=0.7.22 -t pinakes:0.7.22 .
PINAKES_VERSION=0.7.22 tests/docker-smoke.sh   # build + full smoke test
```

---

## Security notes

- Set strong `DB_PASS` / `DB_ROOT_PASS` and a stable `PLUGIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for production.
- Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and forward `X-Forwarded-Proto`; set `APP_CANONICAL_URL` and `FORCE_HTTPS=true`.
- The application internals (`app/`, `config/`, `installer/`, `storage/`, `vendor/`) live outside the Apache `DocumentRoot` (`public/`) and are additionally denied by vhost rules.
- `display_errors`/`expose_php` are off; uploads are capped at 512 MB.
